                <h2>Sundar Pichai</h2>
                <p>
                    Becoming the head of any company is noteworthy, but becoming the CEO of one of the most high-profile businesses in the world gets you into the history books. That's exactly what Sundar Pichai did when he took the helm of Google in 2015 after just 11 years at the company. From humble beginnings as a middle-class student in India to one of the lead product developers on Google Chrome, Pichai's road to the top of Google has been full of twists and turns.

					By most metrics, Pichai's tenure as CEO has been an overwhelming success for the company. Alphabet's revenue is up more than 80% and the company's stock price has risen by almost 90% since his appointment.
